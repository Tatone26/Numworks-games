# Numworks
Some simple games for numworks calculator, to run in python.
Thanks to @ZetaMap, you can run these scripts on your pc with the Kandinksy and the Ion-Numworks modules installed.

I don't think this github page will ever interest anyone but I made it public anyway... On numworks.com, you have a repository of lots of programs (and you can submit your owns apparently).

I use this repo to save all my code, so a LOT of things here don't work, like pong, tetris, chess... It is just some tests !
I don't care about professionnalism so my commit's names don't make any sense, and you should NOT read too much of my code. (for your own safety)

Feel free to download my python code, but I don't think I will create or change anything for now. In the apps folder, I'm working on some games written in Rust that you can install with the numworks website : go to the apps folder, get the .nwa file(s) you want, go to my.numworks.com/apps (on chrome or edge), connect your numworks to your PC, select the file(s) of the game(s), click download and TADA, you have the games installed ! 
PS : you need a fairly recent version of the numworks software, but be careful, the new versions of Epsilon make it impossible (or very difficult at least) to install other operating systems like Omega. I chose the official software with external application, but do what you like.
