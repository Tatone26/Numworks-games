# Numworks Games
Some simple games for numworks calculator, to run in python or as applications ! 
Thanks to @ZetaMap, you can run these python scripts on your pc with the Kandinksy and the Ion-Numworks modules installed.
For more details on the applications (which are far better games), see the Applications paragraph.

I don't think this github page will ever interest anyone but I made it public anyway... On numworks.com, you have a repository of lots of programs (and you can submit your owns apparently).

I use this repo to save all my code, so a LOT of things here don't work, like pong, tetris, chess... It is just some tests !
I don't care about professionnalism so my commit's names don't make any sense, and you should NOT read too much of my code. (for your own safety)

Feel free to download my python code, but I don't think I will create or change anything for now. 

## Applications

In the apps folder, I'm working on some games written in Rust that you can install with the numworks website. There are a few games like Tetris, Solitaire or Snake. It is a lot faster than python, with more possibilities and control. It is still a calculator so it will not be perfect visually (the display is quite slow), but I have done my best. There are still a lot of impossible things with the official software, so consider installing an other one if you want to do some really complex things. 
If you want to create some apps that run on Epsilon, see the https://github.com/numworks/epsilon-sample-app-rust for Rust-based one, https://github.com/numworks/epsilon-sample-app-cpp for C++ and https://github.com/numworks/epsilon-sample-app-c for C. 

### Installation instructions : 
  - go to the "apps" folder
  - download the .nwa file(s) of the game(s) you want
  - go to my.numworks.com/apps (on chrome or edge)
  - follow the instructions on the website, and put the file(s) you downloaded.
  - click DOWNLOAD and you're good to go !
