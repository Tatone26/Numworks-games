# Numworks
Some simple games for numworks calculator, to run in python.
Thanks to @ZetaMap, you can run those scripts on your pc with the Kandinksy and the Ion-Numworks modules installed.

I don't think this github page will ever interest anyone but I made it public anyway... On numworks.com, you have a repository of lots of programs (and you can submit your owns apparently).

PS : ignore pong and tetris, they are not working right now. There are some good versions online somewhere else.
