# Numworks
Some simple games for numworks calculator, to run in python. 
The emulator is not perfect, a lot of functions are still missing (I'm adding them when I need them). 
It has difficulties to work with a lot of Tkinter.canvas items, so complex drawings can be really slow to complete. That's one of the reason to prefer efficient coding !
