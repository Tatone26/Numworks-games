                HOW TO PLAY

    - <LEFT> and <RIGHT> to move
    - <DOWN> to make it fall faster
    - <OK> to rotate it to the right
    - <BACK> to hold the current tetri
    - <CLEAR> (below <BACK>) to pause

    Every full line disappears !
    The more lines you clear at the 
        same time, the more points !
    The level increase every 10 lines, 
        and falling speed with it.
    You lose when there is no space left.
