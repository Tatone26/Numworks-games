                HOW TO PLAY

    - <LEFT> and <RIGHT> to move
    - <DOWN> for soft drop
    - <UP> for hard drop
    - <OK> & <BACK> to rotate left and right
    - <BACKSPACE> (<clear>) to hold the tetri
    - <SHIFT> to pause

    Every full line disappears !
    Try to clear multiple lines at once !
    The difficulty increase every 10 lines.
    You lose when you reach the top. 
    Hold the tetri to keep it for later !
