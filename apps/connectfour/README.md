# CONNECT FOUR

A few informations I want to write somewhere :

- The game is really simple to program. I guess the most difficult thing is checking the diagonals... But it really is a good game to work on to learn some stuff!
- I definitely spent most of my time on the AI. Again, making one is not really difficult : you just have to check all possible states and keep the best one, right ? Right. A PC will do that instantly. Not the Numworks :(
- Making an AI that can have multiple difficulty levels, that is interesting to play against (a bit random), and that runs in at most a few (~10/15) seconds on a calculator was pretty challenging. It can really be improved as I still haven't followed all optimisations you find on the internet, but I want to do something else and it is already pretty good. *Try it !*
