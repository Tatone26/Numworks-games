    - <LEFT> and <RIGHT> to choose position
    - <OK> or <DOWN> to place the coin

    The first player to align 4 coins of 
        his color wins !
    Of course, diagonals work too.   

    The AI may not be very smart, but winning
    against it is surprisingly difficult, 
    even in its weakest setting... Never 
    missing any obvious winning move may be 
    the key after all !
