# FLAPPY BIRD

Just another remake of the classic game, but for Numworks this time. 

I'm not the first to do this and I won't be the last.

Anyway, I think this is an incredible version and I challenge anyone to do a better one with the tools available...

(I'm not an artist, so don't judge too much the looks)


## What makes this impressive

I talk about the limitations in game making capacity of the Numworks calculator in the README in the Apps folder, so go see that for more details.

Here, in trying to make a "real speed" game, the issue was very much graphical : the image needed to be as *smooth* as possible. I quicly realised that my current algorithms for drawing images were far from good enough to draw more than a few squares per frame. After revamping them and making them as fast as possible, making the game look like it does now was **not** an easy task. I pushed the limits of my calculator to a point I didn't think was even possible. 

You can't even imagine the pain and the time I spend making that game. **Hours** of optimisation. Hours of testing and ctrl-Z. 

Thankfully, **everything** I learned and made for this game can be reused easily everywhere else. That was part of the challenge too : make sure the algorithms are as little specific to this game as possible. All the major graphical functions can be called via numworks_utils.
